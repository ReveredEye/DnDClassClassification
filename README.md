# DnDClassClassification

This project aims to build an end-to-end ML pipeline classifying character classes in Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
The data (located in the `data` folder) is borrowed from this link: <https://github.com/oganm/dnddata/tree/master/data-raw>.
Although there are 2 data files, the one I will be using is just the `dnd_chars_unique.tsv` as it has filtered all submissions to each unique character.
